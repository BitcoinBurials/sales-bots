# Bitcoin Burials Scripts
These scripts were originally built for Bitcoin Burials by Bitcoin Burials and were designed to utilise self-contained metadata that can be extracted directly from the image itself. That being said, you may need to modify certain parts of the code to fit your own project's requirements.

# Hosting and Execution
To use these scripts, you will need to host and run them on a platform like AWS or a similar service. Ensure that you have the necessary infrastructure set up before proceeding.

# Usage
These scripts can serve as a useful template for implementing similar functionality in your own projects twitter or discord. Feel free to modify and adapt them as needed. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to our team.
